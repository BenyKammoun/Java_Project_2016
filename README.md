# Java_Project_2016

'GENERAL INFORMATION'

This repository is an application in JAVA for android devices (especially smartphones). 
We are two developers (Ben-Smh'on and I) on this project, and we do it for the JAVA course 2016.

'WAY OF WORKING'

To make things more easy, i propose some rules everyone should follow:

1) You must work on a separate Branch. We will merge them later.

2) Before you code, go to the 'Projects' tab, and search for parts of project that need to be done. You need also to 
   see the 'Issuses' tab and see bugs or problems reported by other colaborators.

3) When you finish to code a project (part of the final app), you should update on the 'Project' card the changes you have made.
   Please, add the date of your changes.

4) When you think the work on a part of the program, on which you have worked, is done, send to others a pull-request to
   let them check-out your code.

5) After everyone participating on the project has agreed on each other changes, you can merge them to the master Branch.


Thank you, and Good luck to us.
