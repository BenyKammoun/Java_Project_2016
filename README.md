# Java Workshop
This project is a basic android app in order to practice the basics of java and android app development. This application is made of two parts: the first one is a platform for tourism companies where they propose their services to the potential customers and on the second one the users can buy a service proposed by the registered companies in the first part. In fact each part is a different app which bind together to a single idea: **__being a platform for both tourism companies and their potential customer__**.
