'WAY OF WORKING'

To make things more easy, i propose some rules everyone should follow:

1) You must work on a separate Branch. We will merge them later.

2) Before you code, go to the 'read me.txt' project's file and search for changes and work already made by others.

3) When you finish to code' you should write on the 'read me.txt' project's file, the changes you have made on the project.
   Please, add the date of your changes.

4) When you think the work on a part of the program, on which you have worked, is done, send to others a pull-request to
   let them check-out your code.

5) After everyone participating on the project has agreed on each other changes you can merge them to the master Branch.
